# IMPROVISUAL
Improvisuals are live visualizations of improvised music. I post new Improvisuals regularly on Instagram:

The visuals are programmed in [Processing](https://github.com/processing/processing). I use microphone and midi input, but you can also use a computer keyboard for testing.

In the videos I route the audio and midi through Ableton Live. This isn't necessary for the code to work, but gives me more possibilities for looping sounds and choose which parts to send to Processing.

I see these Improvisuals as sketches, exercises to quickly explore possibilities. Things will be messy and buggy.
